# c2ffi

Convert a C header `.h` to a FFI (foreign function interface) `.json` data structure for the purposes of generating bindings to other languages.

## Background: Why?

### Problem

When creating applications (especially games) with higher level languages (such as C#, Java, Python), it's sometimes necessary to dip down into C for access to a native library with better raw performance and overall better portability of different low-level APIs accross various platforms. This works great, however, the problem is that maintaining the higher level language bindings by hand becomes time consuming, error-prone, and in some cases quite tricky, especially when the C library changes frequently.

Note that C++ or other low-level languages are not considered as part of the problem scope because they do not align to specific goals. Though, perhaps [Zig](https://ziglang.org) or some other language may emerge in the future as superior to C for such goals. The goals are the following:

- Portability. For better or worse, C *can be used* as the industry's standard portable assembler even if technically speaking it is not. Writing a native library in the C language (with some constraints) and building it for multiple targets such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, etc, is the path of least resistance. This is especially true for more non-traditional targets such as RaspberryPi, WebAssembly or even consoles.

- Interopability. The C language, specfically the usage of data structures and functions in limited scope, is a common demonitor between C and higher level languages. This makes interaction between C and and other languages not only correct but as fast and efficient as possible.

- Maintainability. Writing and maintaining a C code project is arguably simpler due to C being a relatively small language in comparison to C++/ObjectiveC. This makes the C language arguably easier to learn and work with, especially if limited in scope such as avoiding the use of function-like macros. This is important for open-source projects (in contrast to proprietary-enterprise-like projects) where one of the barriers to development is knowledge sharing at scale in a decentralized fashion.

### Solution

Automate the first step of generating bindings for a higher level language by parsing a cross-platform C `.h` file using [libclang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html) and extracting out the minimal FFI (foreign function interface) data as `.json`.

Refer to the following 2 graphs as examples for a FFI between C and target language `X`.

### Limitations: Is my C library FFI ready?

`c2ffi` does not work for every C library. This is due to some technical limitations where some usages of C for cross-platform foreign function interface (FFI) are not appropriate. Everything in the [**external linkage**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1358400/what-is-external-linkage-and-internal-linkage) of the C API is subject to the following list for being "FFI Ready". Think of it as the check list to creating a cross-platform C library for usage by other languages.

Note that the internals of the C library is irrelevant and to which this list does not apply. It is then possible to use C++/ObjectiveC behind a implementation file (`.cpp` or `.m` respectively) or reference C++/ObjectiveC from a C implementation file (`.c`); all that `c2ffi` needs is the C header file (`.h`).

<sup>1</sup>: Do use standard integer types from `stdint.h` such as `int32_t`, `uint64_t`, etc which are portable. Do not use C's primitive integer types directly such as `unsigned long` as they are not garanteed to be portable due to possibly having different bitwidths for target platforms.

Bad
```c
unsigned long value; // is it 4 bytes or 8 bytes?
```

Good
```c
#include <stdint.h>
...
uint32_t value; // 4 bytes
```

<sup>2</sup>: Do not use 64-bit enums due to compiler determinism in C; [in C enums are only well defined for 32-bit in size or less](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41836658/enum-constants-behaving-differently-in-c-and-c#:~:text=The%20expression%20that%20deÔ¨Ånes%20the,value%20representable%20as%20an%20int%20.). 

Bad
```c
enum MY_ENUM
{  
    LARGE_VALUE_1 = 0x1000000000000000,
    LARGE_VALUE_2 = 0x2000000000000000,
};
```

Good
```c
enum MY_ENUM
{  
    VALUE_1 = 0x1,
    VALUE_2 = 0x2,
    VALUE_MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF
};
```

<sup>3</sup>: Do not use bit fields in C. This is because bit fields may have [different bit layouts across different
compilers (e.g. GCC vs MSCV) which may break portability](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25345750).
Instead use bitmasks to get or set the bits of an integer yourself. 

Bad
```c
struct dob {  // What is the sequential order of the struct's fields?
    uint32_t date: 5;  
    uint32_t month: 4;  
    uint32_t year: 12;  
};  
```

<sup>4</sup>: Function-like macros are only possible if the parameters' types can be inferred 100% of the time during preprocessor; otherwise, not possible. **Not yet implemented**.

Bad
```c
#define SUM(a,b,c) a + b + c // What is the type of a?
```

<sup>5</sup>: Object-like macros have full support. The value type is determined by evaluating the value of the macro as an C++ expression using `auto`.

Acceptable
```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024 // Type is int16_t
```

<sup>6</sup>: Types must be explicitly transtive to a function extern, variable extern, or macro-object so that they can be included as part of the FFI. If this is not the case, then the type is not used in the FFI and will not be extracted.

### Platforms

Support for generating the FFI of a C library for different target platforms using `c2ffi` is dependent on two things:

1. A ["Clang target triple"](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html) (a.k.a. "target platform"). Target platforms are identified by a string in a specific format of `arch-vendor-os-environment` and passed to Clang which informs how to read C code.

2. System C header `.h` files of the target platform. The root directory of where the files are located need to be passed to Clang to read C code correctly. The files are often distributed and installed with a software development environment (SDE) or additional downloadable components to the SDE in a form of a software development kit (SDK). By default for Windows, macOS, and Linux, `c2ffi` will try to find these system headers automatically by searching for common default locations.

The following table demonstrates commonly used target platforms.

<sup>1</sup>: Microsoft does not allow open distribution of their software development kits (SDKs) due to their [Microsoft Software License Terms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows-sdk/redist). However, you can [download and install the SDKs here for Windows here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) for your Windows development machine. You will find the important directories for the C headers at `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Kits\10\Include`. This effectively means that to generate the FFI for target platforms which are Windows, `c2ffi` must run from Windows with the Windows SDK installed.

<sup>2</sup>: Apple does not allow copy or usage of their software development kits (SDKs) on non-Apple hardware due to their [service level agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/xcode.pdf). You can download and install XCode through the App Store to gain access to the SDKs for macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, or any other Apple target platform. This effectively means that to generate FFI for target platforms which are Apple, then `c2ffi` must run from macOS with XCode installed. Additional SDKs for each target platform (e.g. macOS, iOS, tvOS) are also installed through XCode.

<sup>3</sup>: Google does not allow copy or usage of their software development kits (SDKs) due to their [Android Software Development Kit License Agreement](https://developer.android.com/studio/terms). You can download and install Android Studio to gain access to the SDKs for Android. This effectively means that to generate FFI for target platforms which are Android, then `c2ffi` must run from Windows, macOS, or Linux with Android Studio installed and additional SDKs for each target platform are also installed through Android Studio or equivalent.

Note that pointers such as `void*` can have different sizes across target computer architectures. E.g., `X86` pointers are 4 bytes and `X64` (aswell as `ARM64`) pointers are 8 bytes. This means that FFIs that `c2ffi` generates between 32-bit and 64-bit target platforms will have different return type sizes, parameter type sizes, or record sizes when using pointers. That being said, 64-bit word size is pretty ubiquitous on Windows these days, at least for gaming, as you can see from [Steam hardware survey where 64-bit is 99%+](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/). Additionally, you can see that the ["trend" is that 64-bit is becoming standard over time with 32-bit getting dropped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#64-bit_operating_system_timeline). If you are planning on targeting modern machines, I would advise making your life simple and just forgeting about target platforms with 32-bit computer architectures such as `X86` and `ARM32`.

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
dotnet tool install bottlenoselabs.c2ffi.tool -g
```

### Usage `extract`

Extract the platform specific FFI using a configuration `.json` file.

`config-extract.json`:
```json
{
  "inputFilePath": "path/to/libary/include/header.h",
  "userIncludeDirectories": [
    "path/to/other_library/include"
    ],
  "targetPlatforms": {
    "windows": {
      "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": {},
      "aarch64-pc-windows-msvc": {}
    },
    "macos": {
      "aarch64-apple-darwin": {},
      "x86_64-apple-darwin": {},
    },
    "linux": {
      "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": {},
      "aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Terminal:
```bash
c2ffi extract path/to/config-extract.json
```

NOTE: The `targetPlatforms` in the `config.json` is a matrix of operating systems to extract the Clang target triples on. In other words, it will only extract the Clang target triple when on the specific operating systems. For example given the `config.json` above, when the current operating system is `windows`, only the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` target triples will extracted.

### Usage `merge`

Once one or more FFI `.json` files have been extracted, merge them together into a cross-platform FFI `.json` file. 

This step is necessary to verify that the platform specific FFIs are indeed cross-platform by checking functions, types, bit-widths, etc, are all the same. If you plan on only targetting a specific platform such as Windows only, you may wish to skip this step.  

Terminal:
```bash
c2ffi merge --inputDirectoryPath /path/to/platform/ast --outputFilePath /path/to/cross-platform-ast.json
```
